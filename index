      <h3>Human–Opponent Modelling in Rock–Paper–Scissors</h3>
      <p class="short">Gesture-controlled Reinforcement Learning game</p>
      <div class="details">
        Developed an interactive Rock–Paper–Scissors game using adaptive
        Reinforcement Learning with real-time hand gesture recognition via
        MediaPipe and OpenCV. Implemented Q-learning, opponent modeling,
        and Markov-style behavior prediction to anticipate player moves.
        Visualized learning progress, win rates, and strategy adaptation.

    <div class="project-card">
      <h3>Agro Deep Learning Framework for Crop Production</h3>
      <p class="short">Multi-source agricultural yield prediction</p>
      <div class="details">
        Implemented a simplified Agro Deep Learning Framework (ADLF) using
        weather parameters, soil conditions, and satellite-derived NDVI data.
        Designed a multi-input neural architecture inspired by precision
        agriculture research to improve yield prediction accuracy over
        traditional ML models.
